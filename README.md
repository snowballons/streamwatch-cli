## Supported Platforms

StreamWatch uses [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) under the hood, so it supports any platform Streamlink does. Enhanced display features are available for:

- YouTube, Twitch, Kick, TikTok, BiliBili, Douyin, Huya, Vimeo, Dailymotion, PlutoTV
- Major European broadcasters (BBC iPlayer, ARD/ZDF Mediathek, RaiPlay, RTVE Play, Atresplayer, Mitele)
- AbemaTV, Adult Swim, Bloomberg, Bigo Live, and more!

If your platform isn't listed, StreamWatch will still try to display what it can, and playback will work if Streamlink supports the URL.

---

## Getting Started

### First Run

- On first launch, StreamWatch creates a config directory, a default `config.ini`, and an empty `streams.json`.
- You'll see a welcome message with instructions.

</p>

### Adding Streams

- From the main menu, press **A** (Add).
- Enter one or more stream URLs (comma-separated for multiple).
  - Example:  
    ```
    https://twitch.tv/streamer1, https://youtube.com/@channel2, https://kick.com/user3
    ```
- Your streams are saved to `streams.json`.

---

## Usage Guide

### Main Menu Navigation

- **[Enter]**: Select a live stream interactively.
- **[Number]**: Play a stream by its number.
- **[L]**: List all configured streams.
- **[A]**: Add new streams.
- **[R]**: Remove streams.
- **[P]**: Play last watched stream (if available).
- **[F]**: Refresh live stream list.
- **[Q]**: Quit StreamWatch.

### Playing a Stream

- Select a stream and StreamWatch launches it in your media player via Streamlink.

### Playback Controls

- **[S]**: Stop stream
- **[N]**: Next live stream
- **[P]**: Previous live stream
- **[C]**: Change quality
- **[M]**: Main menu
- **[D]**: Donate to developer
- **[Q]**: Quit StreamWatch

If the stream ends or you close the player, StreamWatch returns you to the menu. If a stream drops, it will try to reconnect for about 30 seconds.

## Configuration

StreamWatch uses two main files:

### Stream List (`streams.json`)

- Stores your stream URLs.
- **Location:**
  - Linux/macOS: `~/.config/streamwatch/streams.json`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\StreamWatch\\streams.json`
- Manage via the [A] (Add) and [R] (Remove) options.

### Settings (`config.ini`)

- Created on first run, editable with any text editor.
- **Location:** Same as `streams.json`.

Example:

```ini
[Streamlink]
quality = best
timeout_liveness = 10
timeout_metadata = 15
max_workers_liveness = 4
max_workers_metadata = 2
twitch_disable_ads = true

[Misc]
donation_link = https://buymeacoffee.com/snowballons
first_run_completed = true
last_played_url =
```

---

## Logging

- Log file for troubleshooting:  
  - Linux/macOS: `~/.config/streamwatch/logs/streamwatch.log`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\StreamWatch\\logs\\streamwatch.log`
- Includes INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and DEBUG messages.
- Log files are rotated automatically.
