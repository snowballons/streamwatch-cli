## Getting Started

1.  **Run StreamWatch for the first time:**
    ```bash
    streamwatch
    ```
    This will create the configuration directory and files.

2.  **Add streams:**
    - Press `A` in the main menu to add a stream.
    - Enter a stream URL. To add a custom alias, type it after the URL (e.g., `https://twitch.tv/shroud The FPS King`).
    - To add multiple streams, separate them with commas.

3.  **Refresh and watch:**
    - Press `F` to refresh the stream list and see who's live.
    - Select a stream to start watching.

## Advanced Configuration

### Stream Aliases

Assign custom names to your streams for easier identification. When adding a stream, type the alias after the URL:

```
URL(s) [and optional alias(es)]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw Linus Tech Tips
```

### Using a `streams.d` Directory

For advanced stream management, create a `streams.d` directory in your StreamWatch config folder. Inside this directory, create any number of text files (e.g., `gaming.list`, `news.txt`) and add one stream URL per line.

StreamWatch will load all streams from `streams.json` and any files in `streams.d` at startup.

**Note:** The `A` (Add) and `R` (Remove) commands only affect `streams.json`. To manage streams in `streams.d`, you must edit the files directly.

### Importing & Exporting

- **Import (`I`):** Bulk-add streams from any `.txt` file (one URL per line).
- **Export (`E`):** Create a backup of your current stream list (including aliases) to a `.json` file.

### Playback Hooks

Automate your environment by running custom scripts before and after a stream plays.

1.  Create an executable script (e.g., `start_stream.sh`, `end_stream.bat`).
2.  Set the full path to your script in `config.ini` under `pre_playback_hook` or `post_playback_hook`.

StreamWatch passes the following arguments to your script: `url`, `alias`, `username`, `platform`, `quality`.

**Example `hook.sh`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Event for alias '$2' on platform '$4' with quality '$5'" >> ~/stream_events.log
```

---

## Configuration File

Your settings and stream lists are stored in your user configuration directory:

- **Linux/macOS:** `~/.config/streamwatch/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\StreamWatch\\`

The `config.ini` file is created on the first run and can be edited to customize StreamWatch's behavior.

---

uv run pytest --cov=src/streamwatch --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_stream_utils.py
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks manually
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific tools
